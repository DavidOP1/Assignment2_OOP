Sources which helped us understand the alogrithms which we used in this assignment:

1.Dijkstra algorithm for shortest path: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm

2.Center of graph: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szGXkfx9nC8

3.Checking if a graph is strongly connected: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_connected_component

4.tsp(Travelling salesman problem): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem

Explaining the assignment: 

The subject of the assignment is graphs. We were given interfaces which we need to implement.//complete here

NodeData interface: gives us information about the node(vertex), ID , location, etc...

EdgeData interface: gives us information about the edge, since it's a directed graph , this edge has source node and destination node. We can also get the weight of this node.

GeoLocation interface: gives us information about the location of the node in the graph, (x,y,z).

We added a GUI class in which we implement the drawing of the menu and graph.

DirectedWeightedGraph interface: this interface allows us to add new nodes to the graph with existed edges, we can also add new edges to the graph if we want. Just like adding we can also remove edges and nodes, we can get nodes by their ID's also get edges by entering their source node and destination node. You can algo get an iterator for all of the edges of the graph, all of the nodes of the graph, or all of the edges of a specific node. We have a variable called MC which keeps track with changes made to the graph , so when creating the iterator a change in the graph has occured, a RunTime error will be thrown. You can also get the amount of nodes and edges in the graph.

Note: Getting a edge, adding a node, adding or removing a edge from the graph, are done in O(1) complexity, removing a node from the graph is done in O(K) complexity , when 
V.degree=k.

DirectedWeightedGraphsAlgorithms: this is the most important interface, in here we implement all of the algroithms which are being used in the graph.
this interface will allow you to get the shortest path distance between 2 nodes, and get the routh which it takes to get to the node.
We can also check if the current graph is strongly connected, get it's center and do TSP on a given list of citites.
This interface will also allow you to load graph data from a JSON file, or if you create a graph your self , you will be able to save this graph into a JSON file as well.

Note: I added my own class which is called Pair which hold  the values,(index,distance) index of the node we currently travel with , and the distance we made with it so far.
I created this class to use it in our priority queue which is being used in the Dijkstra algorithm, we pull items form the priority queue by the smallest distance available in the queue, and this being done by the comparator, in the Pair class.

Explaining the algorithms:

Center:	

since my ShortestPathDist function creates a hashtable which stores the shortest distance between the src node to each node in the graph, we will only take the biggest shortest distance in that list. we do this to every node in a given graph , and then taking the smallest biggest shortest distance out of all them.
We created a function called maxDistNode(Node.id) which receives nodes id as an argument, this function is completely identical to ShortestPathDist, the only difference that in here we return the whole list of shortest distances from entered node to each node in the graph.

ShortestPathDist:  

this function returns the shortest path between 2 nodes, in here we used the Dijkstra algorithm. This function creates a list with all the shortest distances from the node to each node in the graph, so we take only the node with the id of dest.(node.id==dest).

ShortestPath: 

Works exactly the same as ShortestPathDist, but we always keep the parent node, so we can track and save the route.

I created 2 of my own functions: assistShortest, which create a lists that stores all of the nodes of the route from end to beginning , then in our secojnd function findPath 
we reverse this list and return it, and that's the list which ShortestPath returns.

isConnected:

We initialize a hashtable of visited nodes, saved by keys(ID's) of the node and the values are boolean.
We run a DFS on the graph , and if all of the nodes are not visited , then the graph is not strongly connected. then we reset the hashtable of the visited nodes,
then we reverse all of the edges of the graph and create a new graph , we run DFS on the newly created graph, and if all of the edges are not visited then the graph is not strongly connected, if both DFS's pass then the graph is strongly connected.
For this function I created my own function DFS() which is implemented iteratively.

Problems I had with isConnected is that at the beginning I did DFS recursively , The problem with this that when I ran the 10k node graph I got a stack overflow, th recursion implemntation of DFS used too much memory so I implemented DFS iteratively, which solved the problem.

TSP(Travelling salesman problem):
We are given a list of cities which we need to visit, between every 2 pairs of cities , I run the function ShortestPath and since it returnes the shortest route between those 2 cities, I add it to the list which I need to return at the end.

 How to run the program using the jar:
  Make sure you have the jar file and json  data file of the graph in the same directory, then in the cmd,
  Type: java -jar Ex2.jar "json file name"
How to use the gui:
In the screen opened there is a drop down menu on the left corner, file which will aloow you to load , save files or draw the graph.

Edit button will allow you to add new edges , add new nodes or remove nodes and edges.

Algorithm button will allow you any of the algorithms which we were requested to implement. (center,shortest path route and is the loaded graph connected).
